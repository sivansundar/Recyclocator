# Recyclocator
A waste segregation app. Built as a part of the Accelathon Hack 2018 hosted by Bangalore Chamber of Industry & Commerce (BCIC) 

# Descripton
Recyclocator is a waste segregation application which is used to segregate waste according to their type and what product they are. The core of this app is the ability to earn rewards/vouchers by meeting a set target of trash dumps across the city. This enables the users to think in terms of our environment and incentives and it helps the investing companies to think in terms of Socio Development of the society and drives sales.
This is a win-win sittuation for both parties involved.

## Development
The project is still under development and we are trying to hook a trained ML model onto this. We are also building a physical trash machine using IoT.
