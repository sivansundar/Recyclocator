# Recyclocator
A waste segregation app. Built as a part of the Accelathon Hack 2018 hosted by Bangalore Chamber of Industry & Commerce (BCIC) 

# Descripton
Recyclomator is a waste segregation application which is used to segregate waste according to their type and what product they are. The core of this app is the ability to earn rewards/vouchers by meeting a set target of trash dumps across the city. This enables the users to think in terms of our environment and incentives and it helps the investing companies to think in terms of Socio Development of the society and drives sales.
This is a win-win sittuation for both parties involved.

## Goodies

* Material Design Components
* Butterknife 10.0.1
* ZXING Library to generate QR Code
* Firebase Auth, Realtime Database and Storage
* Firebase ML Kit to host our retrained model
* Tensorflow Lite(*)
* Glide to processes images
* CameraKit

(*) We are facing issues with respect to integrating the `.tflite` files into our project and hence we are sticking to the existing Labling vision API of Firebase MLKit. 
We are working on getting this set up right away.
